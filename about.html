            <h1>Anqi</h1>     
            <p> An undergraduate background in Mathematics was developed alongside a long-standing interest in artistic expression. Art was studied earlier in school, and during university, work within the student union’s publicity team involved designing posters and producing illustrated visuals.
                Dance later became another important form of expression, highlighting the use of the body as a creative medium. Landscape photography followed, where attention to composition and colour became central. These experiences gradually led to craft-making, with phone cases chosen as a personal, everyday medium for creative expression. The project aims to invite more people to take part in making and to express themselves freely through hands-on creation.</p>

            <h1>Dora</h1>     
            <p>Early design experience began in high school through participation in school-based projects creating items such as hats and cups, developing familiarity with the full process from concept to finished object. This foundation continued through long-term independent work in handmade hair accessories and phone cases, with careful attention to material choice, colour coordination, and detailed finishing.
                Further photography training with professional photographers introduced a stronger awareness of composition and light, which has since informed the design process. Craft is viewed as a way to bring warmth, personal aesthetics, and care into everyday objects through making.</p>
